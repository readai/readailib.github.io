Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) ModelFigure1: SPMDLecture Summary: In this lecture, we studied the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model, which can enable the use of a cluster of distributed nodes as a single parallel computer. Each node in such a cluster typically consist of a multicore processor, a local memory, and a network interface card (NIC) that enables it to communicate with other nodes in the cluster.</description>

Introduction to MapReduceFigure1: Introduction to MapReduceLecture Summary: In this lecture, we learned the MapReduce paradigm, which is a pattern of parallel functional programming that has been very successful in enabling “big data” computations. The input to a MapReduce style computation is a set of key-value pairs. The keys are similar to keys used in hash tables, and the functional programming approach requires that both the keys and values be immutable.</description>
